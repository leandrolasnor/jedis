# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

en:
  hello: "Hello world"
  not_found: "Record Not Found"
  dry_validation:
    errors:
      taxpayer_number_invalid: "Taxpayer number is not valid."
      age_must_be_between_18_80: "Age must be between 18 and 80 years old"
      cns_invalid: "CNS Code is not valid"
      invalid_format: "Invalid Format"
  mailer:
    person:
      welcome: "Welcome to my app"
      subject: "Your data was saves!"
      body: "Your data:\n%{data}"
